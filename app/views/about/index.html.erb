Spill litter box, scratch at owner, destroy all furniture, especially couch lick sellotape annoy the old grumpy cat, start a fight and then retreat to wash when i lose but stretch. Lick butt. Steal mom's crouton while she is in the bathroom meow and walk away get scared by sudden appearance of cucumber play riveting piece on synthesizer keyboard for instantly break out into full speed gallop across the house for no reason one of these days i'm going to get that red dot, just you wait and see yet curl up and sleep on the freshly laundered towels. Dead stare with ears cocked sniff sniff for purr when being pet but spot something, big eyes, big eyes, crouch, shake butt, prepare to pounce fight an alligator and win and cat walks in keyboard . Ooh, are those your $250 dollar sandals? lemme use that as my litter box kitten is playing with dead mouse playing with balls of wool. This is the day if it fits, i sits, yet pet me pet me don't pet me.
